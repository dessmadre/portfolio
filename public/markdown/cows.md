### Purpose

The Purpose of the app was to learn how to use Wordpress as a Headless CMS. I'm interest in the JAM stack and when I learned that could leverage Wordpress's platform as a way to create custom webpages without the need of a pre-installed them, and I wanted to know how. With the use a plugion called WPGraphQL I was able to hook into my Wordpress database and gain access to its data, allowing me to display it on a Next.js project. I was able to style it using Tailwind CSS, which made it easier to build teh application.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge with this project was learning how to use GraphQL. I was not familiar with how to use it and take leverage it advantages when it came to fetching data from an API. Another challenge was styling the site, I didn't want to use a component library and instead I opted to use Tailwind CSS. I wasn't familiar with all the utlity classes they offer. After using it on this app, i really liked how easily you could style a component without relying on prebuilt ui components.
