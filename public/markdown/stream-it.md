### Purpose

The purpose of this app was to learn how to build a fullstack React application using Typescript, Apollo, GraphQL. The app has CRUD functionality and the data is being persisted in a MongoDB database. The backend is written in Node.js, and authentication is handled by JSON web Token. Apollo Server interfaces with the backend and sends data responses to the front-end which is handled with Apollo Client.

### Challenges

I purchased a Udemy course that showed me how to make this website. I diverted from the course by using Tailwind CSS to style my project instead of Material UI. I also refactored the components from the original video in order to reduce filesize. One of my challenges with this project was learning how to use and implement monorepos. I had some difficulty building the app and the solution was the clear the cache from both the backend and the front-end in order for the build to be successful.
