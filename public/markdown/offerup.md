#Ralphie's List

### Purpose

The purpose of this app was to createa a catalog for vendors who use OfferUp as platform for selling thier goods. This works by using OfferUp's API that give me access to all the products a seller has available. This app makes it easier for a seller to track thier inventory with a searchbar. This app can be shown to potential buyer and allow them to see the diiferent prodcts a seller has without showing different seller products.

### Challenges

The most challenging part of this project was working with OfferUp's API, unfortuantely it is not public. In order to make the app display a sellers product, I have to to to a sellers page and get the inforamtion from OfferUp anytime a seller posts new merchandise. Nonetheless, I built the app and Ralphie's List is the catalog of my friend Ralph, which I update whenever I remember too.

### Stack Used

This app is created with Next.js. It is styled using SASS.
